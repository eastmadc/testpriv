The following are guidelines, not dogma.  If you're working on
something that's in a usable state but not completely polished,
by all means check it in.  Bringing such a module in line with
the following is encouraged; don't be surprised if someone helps
out with some diffs to that end.

1.
Running a configure script at compile time should be avoided.
It's preferable to check in a static configuration.  For example:
-DHAVE_CONFIG_H 

2.
The QNX recursive make format should be used.  The ideal is to be
able to do something like the following from the base io-pkt
directory:
# make CPULIST=x86 CCOPTS=-O0 DEBUG=-g install

3.
When bringing in new vendor source, one should try to follow the
vendor's directory layout.  This make updating the source easier
in the future via 'svn merge' and vendor branches.

4.
Additions to vendor code should follow the vendor's coding
style.  For NetBSD code this is generally as per their
src/share/misc/style:
http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/share/misc/style

Totally new code should try to follow this format as well
as it's generally in line with the QNX coding guidlines.
