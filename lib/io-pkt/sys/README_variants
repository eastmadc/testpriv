uni variant
-----------
- InterruptDisable() / InterruptEnable() instead of
  InterruptLock()    / InterruptUnlock() which is used
  everywhere else.  This means uni variant absolutely
  can't run on SMP machine.
- All mutexing internally becomes no op so we always
  have to run with one thread.  Exported mutexing
  functions are no ops.

smp variant
-----------
- InterruptLock() / InterruptUnlock(), always mutex
  (may be superfluous if running with one thread).
- Exported mutexing functions based on nthreads.


general variant
---------------
- InterruptLock() / InterruptUnlock(), internal mutexing
  based on nthreads.
- Exported mutexing functions based on nthreads.




What falls out of the above:
----------------------------
- Generally and smp compiled drivers can run with any
  stack on any machine.
- uni stack / driver can't run on smp machine.
- uni driver can't run with stack where nthreads > 1:
  smp variant stack actually running on smp machine or
  smp variant stack passed explicit nthreads override.
